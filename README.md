# Snake Game written in Python by ChatGPT

This respository contains the classic  Snake Game written in Python by ChatGPT.


## Step 1: Install Python

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org). I'm using version 3.12.0 for this sample.

## Step 2: Install Requirements

For this game we are using `pygame`, which is not included in the standard Python library, so you'll need to install it separately. You can do this using `pip`, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `src` directory and type:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Create the Game

I've used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to create the Snake Game in Python. During the process there are seven versions developed, which you can easily find in the `src` folder. The following screenshots show the development process from start to finish.

### V1: Basic structure
